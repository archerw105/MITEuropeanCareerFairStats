          <h4 style="border-top: 1px solid #1c2c6b; padding-top: 10px; margin-top: 10px">How was this visualization made?</h4>

          <h5>Data exploration</h5>

          <p>I am one of the organizers of the career fair so I have access to the registration data. The raw dataset that came from the online fair registration platform consisted of 2090 columns and 2961 rows, and needed a lot of processing and manipulation.

          To understand the data better, I explored it in Tableau first.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm" style="max-width:680px; margin:auto; display:block;">
              <img src="img/tableau-data-exploration.png" alt="Tableau screenshots" class="img-fluid screenshot">
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>However, these initial charts were not fully correct because of the way the CSV file was formed. For example, for the "university" and "degree" columns, multiple values were present for each candidate (i.e., in case they have marked themself as having multiple degrees from multiple schools). Some examples are given below.</p>


          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm" style="max-width:680px; margin:auto; display:block;">
              <img src="img/raw_data.png" alt="Raw data screenshots" class="img-fluid screenshot">
            </div>
          </div>

          <h5>Data wrangling</h5>

          <p>I wrote a Python script to wrangle the data and fix these issues. I used Pandas, a data analysis library (special thanks to Rishabh Chandra for introducing me to it during office hours). My code can be found as a Jupyter notebook in the GitHub repository.</p>

          <p> Essentially, the script has a priority list (e.g., "Postdoc" comes after "PhD") for processing relevant fields (highest degree, university name, field of study). I created these rankings based on the interests of employers. For example, if a student has multiple affiliations and one of them is MIT, they are listed under MIT. If their fields of study include data science and industrial engineering, they are listed under the former. The script also combines equivalent names (e.g., "MIT" and "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"). Finally, it creates a crosstab sheet showing the number of attendees in a separate column for each subgroup (e.g., PhD students at MIT studying computer science: XX many attendees).</p>

          <h5>Web design and development</h5>

          <p>For the Web-based visualization, I used D3.js, D3plus, and Bootstrap. I think the most important thing for me was to show a breakdown of different study fields for the highest attending universities. These two categories of information are those that are most sought-after by the attending organizations. For this purpose, a stacked bar chart was the perfect means. The different colors used make it easier for the viewer to distinguish different majors. Hovering over the bar sections shows the number of attendees in that specific cross-section of the data. By clicking on individual titles in the legend, they can also focus on specific majors and compare the number of attendees across universities. When clicked, the axes are rescaled in an animation to adapt to the new range of the sub-data.</p>
                  
          <p>The second visualization is a simpler one, but it also answers one of the frequently asked questions.  I chose to use a pie chart since it visualizes the ratios of the degree categories with respect to each other. Again, hovering over the degree names reveals the number of candidates in each category.</p>

          <p>I thank Jumana Almahmoud for giving me suggestions for this assignment.
          Overall, I spent approximately 30 hours on the development of this project. The most time-consuming part was the data wrangling process.

                <p><b><u>For MIT and its students</u></b>: Every year, the European Club donates most of the ECF revenue to MIT for the funding of MISTI programs in Europe (ca. $40,000). For more information, please see  <a href= "http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-european-club-leads-in-giving-back-0720" target="_blank">this news report</a> from previous years.</p>

                <p><b><u>For employers</u></b>: The main reason why companies come all the way from Europe to Boston is to meet and recruit top students in US institutions. Particularly, they are most interested in MIT and Harvard students. After each year's fair, they follow up and request statics about the attendees, including their schools, degrees, and fields of interest. Knowing and conveying this information in a clear convincing way ensures they keep coming to ECF every year and we keep donating our revenue to MISTI programs.</p>

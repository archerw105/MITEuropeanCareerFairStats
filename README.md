# Interactive Visualization of MIT European Career Fair Statistics

Final project by M. Doga Dogan

In this project, we develop an interactive webpage that visualizes the statistics of the MIT European Career Fair. It includes numerous visualizations about both the student candidates and employers. We hope that this tool will allow both parties to inform themselves better about the fair to achieve their goals, which are to find jobs in Europe and to attract best talents from top US schools, respectively.

- The /docs folder has the web files and graphics.
- The /dataset-generation folder has the script for processing the raw candidate dataset.

This project was done individually. I am very happy about how this project turned out. I think that this visualization will be really useful to the fair organizers in the future.

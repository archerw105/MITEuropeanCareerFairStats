# Final project: MIT European Career Fair
M. Doga Dogan

Go to https://github.mit.edu/pages/6894-sp20/FP-MIT-European-Career-Fair/ to see the online visualization.

- The /docs folder has the web files and graphics.
- The /dataset-generation folder has the script for processing the raw candidate dataset.

This project was done individually. I am very happy about how this project turned out. I think that this visualization will be really useful to the fair organizers in the future.
